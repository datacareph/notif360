## :package: Installation

### Requirements

There are a few requirements that may already be available on your current Unix-like operating system: 

- `OpenSSL`: Mainly used for SMTP and SSL checks.
- `cURL`: Used for checking website availability and for `Slack` integration.
- `crontab`: Used as a scheduler mechanism.

> These requirements are typically present in Unix-like systems such as `Linux` or `macOS`.

To check if you have these components installed, you can run a simple command in your command-line interface `CLI`:

```sh
openssl version
curl --version
```

## :rocket: Usage
Create project folder and download the updated copy
```sh
mkdir -p /opt/datacareph
cd /opt/datacareph
git clone https://github.com/datacareph/notif360.git
```

#### Copy `env.sample` to `.env` and replace values accordingly

```sh
cd notif360/notif360/
cp env.example .env
nano .env # use your favorite editor
```

To use the tool, you may need the following:
- Domains to check (for SSL validation)
- URLs to check and scan
- SMTP Credentials: You can either use your existing credentials or [contact us](https://www.datacareph.com/contact) for assistance
- SLACK: [URL Endpoint](https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=6839046088980.6830019825238&scope=incoming-webhook&user_scope=) or Add this to your existing Workspace.

- VirusTotal API Key. You can obtain it [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey).

Once you have the necessary requirements, there are two methods to use the tool: directly on your `Host Machine` or within a `Docker Container`, and you can use either approach.

### Method 1: Host Machine Installation

1. Edit your cronjob with your preferred editor (e.g., nano):
```sh
crontab -e
```
> You can use `sudo crontab -e` to gain root privileges and avoid file permission issues.

2. Add the following code into your cronjob

#### You can copy and paste this code accordingly

```
# Notif360 - System monitoring and notification tool.
# Usage: ./run.sh <force_send_notif> <skip_system_check> <skip_virustotal_scan>

# Full scan with force notification: Run the script every 15 days at 9:00 AM
0 9 */15 * * /bin/bash /opt/datacareph/notif360/notif360/run.sh yes no no

# Website and Malware Scan and Disk check: Run the script every day at 10:00 AM
0 10 * * * /bin/bash /opt/datacareph/notif360/notif360/run.sh no no no

# Website Check Only: Run the script every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /bin/bash /opt/datacareph/notif360/notif360/run.sh no yes yes
```
> Save.

> Update `/opt/datacareph/notif360/notif360` with your correct path.

### Method 2: Docker Container Implementation

We are working to seamlessly integrate it with both new and existing Docker containers. Before proceeding, please review the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/datacareph/notif360/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file.

```sh
cd /opt/datacareph/notif360
docker compose up -d
```
> Replace `$WWW_PROJECT_DIR` with your actual project folder.

This will automatically build a new `Docker image` of approximately `15MB` and spawn the `Docker container`.

Check these cron [schedules](https://github.com/datacareph/notif360/blob/main/notif360/20-scheduler) in the docker container.

#### Test it!

> Make sure you have correct values in the `.env` file
```sh
cd /opt/datacareph/notif360/notif360
./run.sh yes no no
```

### Tips

We will gradually update this readme file. Stay connected!

## :family: Beneficiaries

- System Administrators
- DevOps Engineers managing Docker and Kubernetes deployments
- Backend Developers and Engineers
- Blue teams and Defensive Security Professionals
- Cybersecurity Analysts
- End-users who rely on secure and reliable websites while browsing the internet.

## :thinking: Rationale

Imagine managing tens or hundreds of `servers`, `containers`, `apps`, and `websites`. Manually checking and maintaining them on an hourly and daily basis is a heavy lift. To ease this burden, we have developed a solution. While there may be similar or existing tools available, they often consume considerable resources and can introduce vulnerabilities by exposing APIs.

## :fireworks: Features

Here's the feature-rich functionality that this script can provide.

### :white_check_mark: System Monitoring

- **RAM Usage Monitoring:** Tracks memory usage to identify potential issues or bottlenecks.
- **Disk Space Monitoring:** Monitors available disk space to prevent storage capacity issues.
- **CPU Performance Monitoring:** Tracks CPU usage to ensure optimal system performance.

### :white_check_mark: Website Health Checks
- **Virus Scan:** Conducts regular scans to detect and mitigate any malware or malicious code on websites.
- **SSL Certificate Check:** Verifies SSL/TLS certificate validity and configuration to ensure secure connections.
- **Website Uptime Monitoring:** Monitors website availability and responsiveness to prevent downtime.

### :white_check_mark: Customizable Alerts and Notifications
- **Alerts for System Metrics:** Sends alerts when system metrics (RAM, disk, CPU) exceed predefined thresholds.
- **Alerts for Website Health:** Notifies users of website health issues, such as malware detection or SSL certificate expiry.
- **Notification Customization:** Allows users to customize alert settings, including recipients, notification methods, and threshold values.
- **Integration with Email and Slack:** Utilizes SMTP for email notifications and Slack webhooks for real-time communication.

### :white_check_mark: Easy Integration and Automation
- **Simple Configuration:** Provides an easy-to-use configuration interface for setting up monitoring parameters and alert settings.
- **Automation:** Supports automated scheduling for regular system checks and website scans.
